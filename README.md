# üåê Flask + Ngrok Cloud API Demo
A beginner-friendly, cloud-ready microservice built using **Python Flask** and exposed publicly via **ngrok** ‚Äî developed in **Google Colab**. This project demonstrates API deployment, tunneling, and DevOps readiness for cloud platform engineering roles.
## üöÄ Project Overview
This is a minimal web server created using Flask and hosted from Google Colab. It is publicly accessible via a secure **ngrok** tunnel. The goal is to simulate a cloud service API environment suitable for learning:
- Web API design
- REST endpoints
- Debugging & Deployment via tunnels
- Public exposure of services
- Ideal for cloud and DevOps internships
